### How React Come into Action
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012.

As the Facebook Ads app got an increasing number of features, the team needed more people to keep it running flawlessly. The growing number of team-members and app-features slowed them down as a company. Over time, their app became difficult to handle, as they faced a lot of cascading updates.

After a while, engineers at Facebook couldn’t keep up with these cascading updates. Their code demanded an urgent upgrade to become more efficient.
